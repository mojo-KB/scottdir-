<ul>
<li>
Based on problem description, define HTML display
needed for each of the steps and add them to the
problem html page, to display all needed html (some empty
dynamic elements.
<li>
Add standard Javascript libraries needed to parse html
elements like radio, checkbox, and select.
Add Javascript entries to send and receive messages and
responses to implement each step in the processing of
interaction with the Web server.
<li>
Initialize the form by creating an httpRequest object
and hiding elements not needed in the first step.
Use either an onLoad function or add initialization to the end
of the html page.
<li>
Starting with an initialization event on the initial display,
like a button click, trigger the beginning of a sequence of
events that will solve the problem.
<li>
Implement a CGI program to implement the server side for each
of the steps in the interaction of your Javascript/HTML 
interface with the Web server. A single CGI program will be
sufficient for this course, to parse the request messages and
determine which step in processing they correspond to. 
<li>
Debug the program by triggering the first event and verifying that
each step is performed properly. Alerts can be used, along with the
debugging console, to assure that the proper dynamic HTML code is 
produced for each step and trace the program execution until it
executes correctly.

Hint: Start with HTML from a page you worked on:
<ul>
<li>
Modify the HTML definition to the new problem requirements
<li>
Modify the variable names in the Javascript functions to
match the names in your new HTML code.
<li>
Modify the names in the Javascript sentTo functions to
represent the names you are using for the steps in your new code.
</ul>
Hint: Start with a CGI program you worked on:
<ul>
<li>
Modify the variables in the CGI program that define the entry points
for each step in the interaction with the Javascript program running
on the Web browser.
<li>
Modify the CGI code (Perl) to implement the functions needed by the
Javascript program on the browser and print any needed response data
for the response to the Web browser.
</ul>
